        <h3>My History</h3>
        <p>
          Looking back at the year 2000 when I landed in this incredible
          country. Now my country USA. It's been a challenge and amazing ride at
          the same time but always grateful to be a citizen here.
        </p>

        <h3>Early Years</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing my Graphic Design studies in Mendoza, Argentina I
          started working as an Administration Manager for an Internet provider.
          I enjoyed the oportunity to learn about cable moden, internet at that
          time was not as popular as it is today. I was able to put my skill to
          work creating a system for this company that was just starting. It was
          a great started and learning about internet was exciting.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A couple of years after, I realized that I wanted to come to live in
          USA, so I started planning my move. It took me few months to organize
          my life. I needed to pack my old life and started again in the States.
          It was extremely exciting moment, although scary too. I was in my 20's
          at the time and I didn't speak a word of English. I didn't have family
          nor friends in the State either.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>
          I can believe, when I look back, and see that was 21 years ago. Happy
          to be here and been able to travel and speak few languages. I'm always
          eager to learn and constantly taking curses. That curiosity lead me to
          started my career as developer. I have to admit that studied on my own
          throw videos and free curses only confused me. I needed to find a
          learning project to build my foundation in development. So, I found
          'SheCodes' - and here I am already as Front-End Developer.
