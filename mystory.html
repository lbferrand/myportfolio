            <p>
              Looking back at the year 2000 when I landed in this incredible
              country. Now, my country USA ❤️ . It's been a challenge and an
              amazing ride at the same time, but always grateful to be an
              american citizen.

        <h3>Early Years</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing my Graphic Design studies in Mendoza, Argentina I
          started working as an Administration Manager for an Internet provider.
          I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about cable modem, internet at that
          time was not as popular as it is today. I was able to put my skill to
          work creating a system for this company that was just starting. It was
          a great beginning and learning about the internet was exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of years later, I realized that I wanted to come to live in
          USA, so I started planning my move. It took me few months to organize
          my life. I needed to pack my old life and start again in the States.
          It was an extremely exciting moment, although scary too. I was in my
          20's at the time and I didn't speak a word of English. I didn't have
          family nor friends in the State either.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>
          I can't believe, when I look back, and see that it was 21 years ago.
          Happy to be here and to be able to travel and speak a few languages.
          I'm always eager to learn and constantly taking courses. That
          curiosity lead me to start a career as a developer. I must admit that
          study on my own through videos and free courses only confused me. I
          needed to find a learning process to build my foundation in
          development. So, I found 'SheCodes' - and here I am a Front-End and
          React Developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Nobody can predict the future, but we can all work for a better one.
          So, I am dreaming of having an incredible career as a Developer.
          Increasing my knowledge to be able to work as Software Engineer, my
          plans are to grow this portfolio with more work done in React, Ruby
          and Ruby on Rails which are my next objective. Having some experience
          on these languages and currently working in IT, these skills will
          allow me to expand my frontier.
