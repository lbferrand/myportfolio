        <h3>Early Years 1990's</h3>
        <p>
          After completing my Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design in 1995 in
          Argentina, I began my professional journey as an Administrative
          Manager for an Internet provider. This role sparked my curiosity about
          computer software at a time when cable modems and internet technology
          were still emerging. I embraced the opportunity to learn about these
          innovative technologies, and I applied my skills to develop a new
          administrative system and designed the company’s logo, blending my
          technical and creative abilities. This experience was a tremendous
          foundation, allowing me to explore the world of internet and software
          development in its formative years. A few years later, I moved to the
          United States, where I have continued to grow both personally and
          professionally, building upon my initial excitement and passion for
          technology and design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>
          I am a dedicated and hardworking professional with over 3 years of
          experience as a Front-End Developer and more than 15 years as a
          Quality Assurance Engineer in the IT industry. My expertise extends
          beyond development and QA—I have significant experience as a Business
          Analyst, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical teams and
          business stakeholders. This combination allows me to deliver
          user-focused, high-quality solutions that meet both technical
          standards and business goals. I hold certifications as a Front-End
          Developer and React Developer, and I am committed to continuous
          learning to stay current with new software languages and technologies.
          My goal is to become a proficient Full Stack Developer in the near
          future. I am truly passionate about coding and always eager to apply
          my broad skillset to tackle new challenges and create impactful
          digital experiences. During my experience in the healthcare industry,
          I actively participated in daily Scrum meetings to discuss, plan, and
          execute effective testing strategies for application user stories and
          features. I was involved in every phase of the software development
          lifecycle, including requirements gathering, system design,
          development, version control, testing, and deployment. My
          responsibilities included designing, executing, and documenting
          comprehensive manual and automated test plans (using RSpec) for
          healthcare software applications and web portals. I developed and
          maintained both black box and white box tests, leveraging Ruby and
          Ruby on Rails for test development and automation. I managed and
          queried databases such as Postgres, PGAdmin3, and SQLite to validate
          data integrity and support a variety of test scenarios. Throughout
          projects, I collaborated closely with product owners, developers, and
          stakeholders to ensure project deliverables were aligned with
          organizational goals and regulatory requirements, promoting
          transparency and effective communication across teams.

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          As I look toward the future, my primary goal is to advance my career
          as a Software Engineer by deepening my expertise in technologies such
          as React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Python—skills I am actively
          developing as part of my portfolio. Building on my current experience
          as an IT engineer, I am also embracing Artificial Intelligence, both
          as a knowledge domain and as a practical tool to help organizations
          achieve their business objectives. By integrating AI into my skillset,
          I aim to drive smarter, data-informed decisions, streamline processes,
          and enable innovation across projects. My ability to combine software
          engineering with quality assurance and business analysis ensures that
          I deliver robust, scalable, and business-aligned solutions. I am
          committed to continuous learning and passionate about leveraging
          advanced technologies to help companies accelerate digital
          transformation and achieve greater success.
