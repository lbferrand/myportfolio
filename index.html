            Welcome to My Portfolio, my name is Luciana. I'm an Argentinean girl
            living in Florida for more than 20 years. I came to USA in 2000 and
            it's been an amazing journey. First learning the language which I
            always found it fascinating. That helped me to learn fast and easy.
            Then adapted myself to the culture and diversity of people. I
            studied Graphic Design in Mendoza, Argentina and I didn't plan to
            get into Technology, but in 2007 I started working in IT as Quality
            Assurance Analyst. That job allowed me to develop an interest toward
            coding and development. Big part of my job was making sure that the
            code was doing what it was expected and finding any possible issue
            that the user might found. Soon I discovered that I wanted to be the
            one that create an experience for the user, not simple making sure
            that the code worked. There is a world of possibilities to create
            and having a designer background I am able to freely create and get
            to the users. I hope you enjoy visiting my website and feel free to
            contact me for suggestions and any questions you might have. It's a
            pleasure to receive feedback. I'm excited to share with you my
            projects and I hope you find them as good as I felt when I created
            them. Enjoy!
          </p>
